# Porting to esp32: happier flow and temp sensors

While working on a customer project, it clearly appeared that the limited
ressources of the selected MCU would be hindering our progress. Adding
a second arduino was kludy, at best, so I started looking at the esp32
as a replacement.

## Features:
- Full resolution arbitrary number of digital temperature probes
- Robust flow measurement with constant minimal resolution
